Historic photographs in public collections very often lack basic classificatory tags â€“ whether a picture is an interior or exterior view, has the picture been taken from ground level or from a raised viewpoint (a higher floor window or tower), is it a view photograph depicting mainly a place or a reportage photo about an event etc. Most of these decisions are easy to make for everyone only by looking at a picture, so it is useful to capture that information that would enable bulk filtering of images afterwards.

[Sift.pics](https://sift.pics) is a participatory crowdsourcing application for that kind of binary categorisation about images. We take in pictures from public collections that users start to browse and ask them to make couple of sorting decisions, they can favorite (bookmark) images, see the title of the image and open the image in an official web repository.

Sift.pics is a spin-off of [**Ajapaik**](https://ajapaik.ee) and in the future we'd like to include the functionality of Sift.pics on the main Ajapaik platform.
